"With the Turris router you can join Project Turris which is a non-profit "
"research project founded by the CZ.NIC association, a .CZ domain "
"registry. By joining the project, your router will act as a probe which "
"analyzes traffic between your home network and the Internet and helps to "
"identify malicious data flows. Once such a flow is detected your router "
"notifies the Turris headquarters which can compare the flow with data "
"from the rest of the probes and assign it a threat level. If the flow is "
"identified as an attack Turris headquarters can prepare an update which "
"is distributed to every Turris router and helps them to protect "
"themselves against the attack."
